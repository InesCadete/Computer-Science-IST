# Project 2

## Description
This project simulates an animal ecosystem where various species interact within a bounded environment. It explores dependencies between functions, object manipulation, and logical operations to model behaviors such as movement, reproduction, and survival.

## Features
Position Management: Defines and manipulates 2D positions within the ecosystem.
Animal Behavior: Implements constructors, selectors, and modifiers for animals, distinguishing between predators and prey.

Ecosystem Management: Handles a structured environment with obstacles, animals, and movement logic.
Simulation Mechanics: Includes age progression, hunger mechanics, reproduction, and movement prioritization.

## How It Works
The ecosystem is represented as a grid with obstacles and animals.
Animals move based on predefined rules, with predators hunting prey.
Each step in the simulation updates age, hunger, and reproduction states.
This project provides a foundation for ecosystem modeling, demonstrating dependencies between functions and complex object interactions.

## How to Test
Run python projeto2(1).py.
