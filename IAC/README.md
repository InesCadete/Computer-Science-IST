## 🎮 **Project: Space Rover Game**
The project is an **assembly-based game** where a **rover moves horizontally** across a space-themed environment using keyboard inputs. The game features:
- **Rover controls** (left/right movement via defined keys)
- **Falling meteors** generated at random positions
- **Hexadecimal counter** that can be incremented or decremented using the keyboard
- **Sound effects** triggered by specific actions

## 🛠 **Technologies Used**
- **Assembly Language** (Low-level programming for hardware interaction)
- **Memory Management** (Stack and registers for efficient data handling)
- **Interrupts & Flags** (To manage user inputs and game mechanics)
- **Bitwise Operations & Logic Gates** (For control flow and game logic
