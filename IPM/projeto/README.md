## ðŸ“Œ **Course Overview**
This course introduces the critical role of human-computer interaction (HCI) in computer science, emphasizing its historical significance and impact on modern technology. Students explore interactive technologies and learn about perception-action models, key to understanding user interaction. The course covers iterative development processes for interactive systems, prototyping techniques, and methods for analyzing users and contexts. Students gain practical experience with user evaluation through predictive, heuristic, and participatory methods. Finally, the course delves into the design and construction of visual interfaces, focusing on interaction devices, styles, and technologies essential for effective user engagement.

## ðŸ“‘ **Project Reports**
The first project was focused on a purely static design of an application in figma, independent from the specific implementation. The first step when developing in frontend.
The second project was more "hands-on", integrating design features and changes to an already existing web application in javascript.
