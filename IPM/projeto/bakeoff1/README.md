# **Bake off 1-> Figma Project **

## ðŸ“Œ **Project Overview**
In this project, we applied principles of human-machine interaction (HMI) to design an intuitive and user-friendly application, with a focus on creating a seamless frontend experience. Using Figma for planning, we emphasized minimalism to ensure a clean, distraction-free interface that prioritizes ease of use. We carefully considered user experience (UX) principles, making navigation simple and interactions intuitive. By minimizing visual clutter, we aimed to enhance user engagement and satisfaction. The applicationâ€™s design follows the belief that a streamlined interface improves human-technology interaction. Ultimately, the goal was to create an interface that feels natural and effortless to use.
