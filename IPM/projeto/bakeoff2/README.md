# **Bake off 2-> Javascript Project **

## ðŸ“Œ **Project Overview**
In this project the focus was frontend development, as the backend logic had been already made.
The goal was to maximize user experience by helping them reduce the amount of time taken to identify the word shown on top of the screen in the array of circles (each one with a word). The words were cities in this case (present in the .csv file).
Through various iterations of changing the layout of the words, shapes & colours, we applied general concepts from the course, as well as other specific psychological measures to ensure better performance.
