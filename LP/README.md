# ðŸŒŸ **LP- Logic in Programming ** ðŸŒŸ

## ðŸ“Œ **Course Overview**
This course covers the foundations of logic in programming, starting with propositions and arguments, essential for constructing logical reasoning. Students explore propositional logic, focusing on deductive systems and propositional resolution, before advancing to first-order logic and its resolution techniques. The course also introduces logic programming paradigms, with a primary focus on PROLOG. Students learn how to use logic for problem-solving, applying formal reasoning in the development of algorithms and programs. The course emphasizes the importance of logical systems in programming and artificial intelligence.---

## ðŸ“‘ **Project Reports**
The project was focused on working with lists in a recursive or iterative way (applying logic concepts). 

This project involved solving a puzzle using Prolog and focuses on operations with lists, such as extracting, manipulating, and analyzing data. Key predicates include ilhas/2, which generates the list of islands in a puzzle, and vizinhas/3, which determines neighboring islands based on spatial relationships. The project also applies recursive programming and list processing techniques to filter and manipulate the puzzle data, such as identifying terminated islands or removing certain islands from the list. By leveraging Prolog's pattern matching and backtracking capabilities, the project allows efficient problem solving in the context of spatial puzzles.
