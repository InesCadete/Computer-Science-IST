# ðŸŒŸ **PO- Object-Oriented Programming ** ðŸŒŸ

## ðŸ“Œ **Course Overview**
This course introduces Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts using Java. It covers fundamental topics such as classes, methods, and objects, along with coding conventions and control flow structures. Students will learn key OOP principles like inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and composition while exploring more advanced concepts like exceptions, collections, and I/O. The course also emphasizes UML diagrams, helping students understand the importance of design patterns (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Strategy) for scalable and maintainable software development. By applying these techniques, students develop a strong foundation in object-oriented design and software architecture.

## ðŸ“‘ **Project Reports**
This project was similar to the Microsoft Excel concept, using a grid of cells that can represent values for mathematical expressions. 
The project had two stages of development and among other aspects, the final stage implemented the "Observer Design pattern", which made it possible for cells to update when changes were made to cells that influenced the result.
